<mark>**3. Prioritized Control Implementation for Foundational Security:**</mark>

  

<mark>While EDR and DLP address advanced threats and data protection, the following foundational controls from the assessment checklist should be prioritized for immediate implementation if currently absent, as they are critical for overall system and architecture protection:</mark>

<mark>| **Encryption**                       | Protects sensitive data both in transit and at rest, making it unreadable to unauthorized parties. Essential for meeting compliance standards, especially for PCI DSS and GDPR. | Data interception, breach exposure, non-compliance with GDPR/PCI DSS data protection requirements. |</mark>
<mark>| **Firewall**                         | Acts as the primary network boundary defense, controlling incoming and outgoing traffic based on security policies.                                                             | Unauthorized network access, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, network intrusion.                   |</mark>

<mark>| Recommendation                                                            | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Associated Compliance/Risk Mitigation                                                                                                                                                                    |</mark>
<mark>| **Formalize and audit GDPR breach notification procedure.**           | The GDPR mandates a 72-hour notification window for breaches involving E.U. customer data. A tested, formalized plan is essential to meet this strict requirement.                                                                                                            | Non-compliance with **GDPR** breach notification timelines, significant fines, and loss of E.U. customer trust.                                                                                      |</mark>
<mark>| **Reinforce PCI DSS-compliant secure storage and transmission.**      | All systems that store, process, or transmit credit card data must adhere strictly to PCI DSS requirements, including strong access control (Least Privilege) and regular vulnerability scanning. This is crucial as Botium Toys handles payment dates/information.           | Exposure of customer financial data, immediate and severe **PCI DSS** non-compliance penalties, potential loss of ability to process credit card payments, and legal liabilities.                    |</mark>
<mark>| **Implement and monitor PII/SPII data classification and inventory.** | Compliance with both **GDPR** (data minimization, storage limitation) and **PCI DSS** (data scope reduction) requires a precise understanding of where sensitive data resides (Data-at-Rest). This enables effective application of controls like Encryption and DLP. | Failure to enforce privacy policies, inability to demonstrate accountability under **GDPR**, unnecessary expansion of the **PCI DSS** scope, leading to increased audit costs and risk exposure. |</mark>
